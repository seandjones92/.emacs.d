If the buffer is "startscreen.org" then I don't want number lines and
the buffer should be read only

Code here should help generate dynamic content, it will be put into "init.org"
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun my-projects ()
    (insert "My Projects:\n")
    (dolist (project projectile-known-projects)
      (insert (concat "[[file+emacs:" project "][" project "]]\n"))))

  (defun my-recent-files ()
    (insert "Recently Opened files:\n")
    (dolist (rfile recentf-list)
      (insert (concat "[[" rfile "]]\n"))))

  (defun full-dashboard ()
    (my-projects)
    (insert "\n")
    (my-recent-files))

  (defun my-dashboard ()
    (if (require 'projectile)
        (full-dashboard)
      (my-recent-files)))
#+END_SRC
